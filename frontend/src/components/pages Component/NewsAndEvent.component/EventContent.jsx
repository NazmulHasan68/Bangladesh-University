      University events are essential as they foster community, enhance learning beyond 
      the classroom, develop skills, create networking opportunities, promote wellness, 
      encourage creativity, support fundraising, and celebrate achievements. They enrich
      the academic experience, prepare students for future careers, and build a vibrant, 
      inclusive campus culture.</p>
