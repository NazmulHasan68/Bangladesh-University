        <p>The result of a student may be withheld at the report of an invigilator or course teacher for adopting unfair means. Adoption of unfair means may also lead to expulsion of the student from the program and the university. Necessary punitive measures in this regard will be taken in the meeting of a committee constituted by the authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Appeal against punishment:</strong></p>
        <p>If a student is aggrieved by an order of punishment awarded by the authority as per decision of the Disciplinary Committee, he/she may file an appeal before the Vice Chancellor within one month of passing such an order. The Disciplinary Committee and Vice Chancellor shall, as an appellate authority, review the case and pass such order as thought proper and just.</p>
